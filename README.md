This is the repository for my soundscape narrative project where I will be recording myself walking around Oakland in the early morning hours (1am-4am).

*There will be pretty graphics and fancy stuff coming to this readme sooner or later.*

### Project Proposal

For my soundscape project, I'd like to encapsulate Oakland at night. I live in North Oakland and I'm quite a night owl! Almost all of my classes are afternoon and night classes so my sleep schedule is like 4 am to 11 am some nights. I like to go on walks around Oakland sometimes when it's this late at night because it's pretty interesting. Oftentimes it's calm and serene, but sometimes there are interesting things to see and hear.

I would do audio recordings briefly describing where I'm at and overlay them with chill background music and sound effects, and try to incorporate any cool background noise as well as any interesting sounds (such as a train, etc). I'd probably walk to different areas of Oakland on different nights and just make observations for this project. If there wasn't anything interesting, I might tell stories about interesting things I've seen walking around Oakland in the past.
